@article{spice_model,
	abstract = {Data conversion devices are used to convert real world analog signals into a digital representation, a useful technique in a number of areas of signal processing. The basic circuit in the data conversion field is the digital to analog converter (DAC) which translates a digital representation of a signal into its analog equivalent. Many analog to digital converter (ADC) circuits use the DAC as a component in the overall system. DAC circuits are characterized by a number of parameters such as dynamic range (DR), resolution (RES), full scale range (FSR), signal to noise ratio (SNR), offset error, gain error and nonlinearity [1]. Many of these parameters are functions of the number of bits used to represent the analog signal (namely DR and SNR), others are based on the actual circuit construction (errors and linearity). Figure 1 shows an idealized example of the various static errors (offset, gain and linearity) that can be encountered with a DAC [1]. In the figure, the bold line represents the ideal DAC transfer characteristic. Gain error, as the name implies, causes an increase (or a decrease) in the full scale output value of the circuit. Offset error describes a shift in the transfer characteristic from its ideal case. Linearity describes the deviation from the ideal case.},

These filters are used over a wide range of sample rates and are well supported in terms of tools, software, and IP cores. Another type of digital filter is the Infinite Impulse Response (IIR) filter, which tends not to be so well supported and is generally used in the lower sample rates, that is, less than 200 kHz. The IIR filter, known as a recursive filter, uses feedback to compute outputs. This white paper covers the different kinds of IIR filters and structures, and, with the use of The MathWorks{\textregistered} tools, shows how these structures can be mapped to the Xilinx{\textregistered} FPGA architecture. A final consideration is how to pipeline IIR filters to support higher sample rates.},

However, it requires study at a practical level in order to complete its deployment. This thesis examines the practical implementation of different DSP algorithms using FPGA devices. In our first contribution, we investigate the performance of a quadrature demodulator when implemented on FPGA. In the second contribution, we design a switch in the transmitter of wireless system operating under orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Here we devise a simple FPGA design to utilize feedback from the receiver aimed at reducing interference present in the system. In the third contribution, we present an efficient FPGA design for real-time convolution/correlation, as an essential component in the electronics in most wireless systems. Throughout the thesis, our emphasis is on the practical aspects of DSP.},

@phdthesis{vehicle_sysgen_xilinx,
	abstract = {The goal of this research was to explore a new and improved software development tool for the implementation of control algorithms on Xilinx Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA). The Simulink plug in, System Generator, complements traditional Hardware Description Language (HDL) by providing a higher level graphical language for the development of FPGA designs. The design is then translated into the lower level required by the Xilinx{\rq}s ISE program. By utilizing this graphical based higher level of abstraction at the design entry level, the requirement of a detailed knowledge of HDL languages is no longer required. Because of this new environment the time required to implement the previously developed control design on the FPGA is reduced. The initial work began with a study of System Generator capabilities. One of the primary areas of interest is the difference on how the mathematical model representations are implemented between Simulink and the logic based hardware. From this initial work, a methodology for conversion between the developed and verified Simulink design and hardware implementation was obtained. As a case study, a control design was implemented for a Simulink model of an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV) based on an RC-Truck. The control system consists of a simple mission planner to generate a vector of waypoints, a proportional-integral velocity vi controller and a proportional heading controller. The derived hardware design process is then utilized and validated by converting the control system into the available System Generator blocks. The final verification of the FPGA design was a hardware-in-the-loop simulation utilizing a Xilinx prototyping board. This design example demonstrated the validity of the presented approach as an efficient and reliable method for rapid system prototyping for designs developed within the Simulink environment.},
